c                           when convergence was achieved.  if

c                           iterations, infer(j) will be greater than

c                           ier = 33 indicates failure to converge with-
c                             in itmax iterations for at least one of   
c                             the (n) new roots.

c   remarks      muller always returns the last approximation for root j
c                in x(j). if the convergence criterion is satisfied,    
c                then infer(j) is less than or equal to itmax. if the   
c                convergence criterion is not satisified, then infer(j) 
c                is set to either itmax+1 or itmax+k, with k greater    
c                than 1. infer(j) = itmax+1 indicates that muller did   
c                not obtain convergence in the allowed number of iter-  
c                ations. in this case, the user may wish to set itmax   
c                to a larger value. infer(j) = itmax+k means that con-  
c                vergence was obtained (on iteration k) for the defla-  
c                ted function                                           
c                              fp(z) = f(z)/((z-z(1)...(z-z(j-1)))

c                but failed for f(z). in this case, better initial      
c                guesses might help or, it might be necessary to relax  
c                the convergence criterion.                             
c                                                                       
C ENM -- made all variables double precision that were real
C ENM 3 jan 2006 -- For use with prep3d.f iabsorp=12 option,
C   need to modify so that the function f takes two input variables
C   but only one is used, so no need to rewrite all the dispfun code
C   in eric_disp.f. (uses dum, which is the variable for eps in dispfun)
